Although all of this poject was done in a Jupyter Server Environment (not using Conda), this process should work equally well within a standard conda environment. For this reason a YAML file was designed for those interested in running this through a simple conda environment and can be found [here](https://github.com/RIT-Environmental-Genomics/Toxicology/blob/main/1.2_De_Novo_Pipeline/rnaseq_De_Novo.yml).

A majority of this project for De Novo was run on a server limited to 2-8 cores and 20-60GB DDR3 RAM 
This project can be run on minimum of these specs but was increased due to time constraints and limitations of those working on this pipeline.
